* Hash table in C

This is project for learning, implemented simple hash table using double hashing for collision handling.

Double hashing aims to solve the clustering problem. To do so, we use a second hash function to choose a new index for the item. Using a hash function gives us a new bucket, the index of which should be evenly distributed across all buckets. This removes clustering, but also removes any boosted cache performance from locality of reference. Double hashing is a common method of collision management in production hash tables.

Hash table resizes itself when *load* (number of items / size) is more than 0.7 and resizes down when *load* less than 0.1.
